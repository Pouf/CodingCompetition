# You are provided with a table which associates MIME types to file extensions.
# You are also given a list of names of files to be transferred and for each
# one of these files, you must find the MIME type to be used.

# The extension of a file is defined as the substring which follows the last
# occurrence, if any, of the dot character within the file name. If the
# extension for a given file can be found in the association table (case
# insensitive, e.g. TXT is treated the same way as txt), then print the
# corresponding MIME type. If it is not possible to find the MIME type
# corresponding to a file, or if the file doesnâ€™t have an extension, print
# UNKNOWN.
