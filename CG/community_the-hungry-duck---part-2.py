# You are a duck sitting in the top left field of a WÃ—H-sized lake.
# In every field of the lake is a different amount of food.
# Your duck is only allowed to move to the right or down.
# What is the maximum amount of food you can eat before reaching the bottom
# right field?

# This puzzle is a followup to The hungry duck - part 1
# This time you are swimming on bigger lakes. Performance is important.
# 0 < W,H <= 100
# 0 < Amount of food < 256
